# RNA Seq Analysis Projects
### By LuJason

Hey,  
what we have here is a compilation of some **Bulk RNA Seq Analysis** I performed as I learnt R & R Studio.  

Datasets were downloaded from **Gene Expression Omnibus ([GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/))**

## Project 1  
- **Dataset ID:** GSE183325 
- **Study title:** [The transcription factor DDIT3 is a potential driver of dyserythropoiesis in myelodysplastic syndromes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35192-7)  
- **Description:** Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with increased incidence in elderly individuals. Genetic alterations do not fully explain the molecular pathogenesis of the disease, indicating that other types of lesions may play a role in its development. In this work, we will analyze the transcriptional lesions of human HSCs to explore how aging and MDS are characterized

## Project 2  
- **Dataset ID:** GSE60450
- **Study title:** [EGF-mediated induction of Mcl-1 at the switch to lactation is essential for alveolar cell survival](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb3117)
- **Description:** This dataset GSE60450 contains the gene expression profiles of luminal and basal cells from different developmental stages. Luminal and basal cells were harvested from the mammary glands of virgin, 18.5 day pregnant and 2 day lactating mice (2 mice per stage).
- **Task:** Perform a differential expression analysis (DEA) to identify the transcriptional changes associated with the development stage in luminal cells. --> Using *Limma-Voom*
